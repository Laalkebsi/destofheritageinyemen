For millennia, the country&#39s traditional masons passed on their local skills and craftsmanship, creating unique spaces and architecture that provided a sense of belonging and protected inhabitants. </p> <p>During the 2011 Arab Spring, Yemen received media attention following a civil unrest initiated by the Houthis that eventually led to the resignation of President Saleh in 2012. With the Houthis gradually gaining more control of the country, Saudi Arabia formed a coalition of eight Arab nations to defeat the Houthis in March of 2015, with weapon and intelligence aid from the U.S. and the U.K. The results were disastrous, with thousands of civilians dead and millions in need of humanitarian aid. </p>',

While Yemen is familiar with heritage destruction over years of damages from civic tension, extremists, and preservation mismanagement, numbers of destroyed sites have skyrocketed since the Saudi coalition. </p> <p> This project aims to visualize the effects of Yemen war on cultural heritage professionals in the first two years after the Coalition, using Yemeni professional&#39s list of destroyed sites and give each confirmed site its deserved place on the map. As a result, the aim of this project is to provide an independent resource, reporting confirmed destruction of heritage. Another aim is to create a new dialogue between local Yemenis and international organizations and Institutions. Furthermore, visualizing destruction is also a way to detect noticeable patterns that may reveal intentions and deliberate acts. </p>',
